## Introduction
This official Zendesk module developed by wagento.

## Version
We are adding a new version management to make module installation available through composer, so this is the table for reference: 

Magento Version | Composer prefix 
----            | ---- 
2.0.x           | 220.x.x 
2.1.x           | 210.x.x
2.2.x           | 200.x.x

So if you are in magento 2.0.x to install by composer just execute: `composer require wagento/zendesk:200.0.1`

BUT in file `etc/module.xml` version will be the same for all composer version, use `setup_version` as global version reference.

## Support
If you are facing any issue with module installation and configuration please send an emil to support@wagento.com
